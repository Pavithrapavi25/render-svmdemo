Customer Shopping Prediction (Flask & ML)
Overview
This is a Flask-based web app that predicts whether a customer will shop or not based on user input. It uses a trained machine learning model (model.pkl) to make predictions.

Tech Stack
✅ Frontend: HTML, CSS (via Flask templates)
✅ Backend: Flask (Python)
✅ Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
✅ Deployment: Works locally & can be deployed on Heroku, Render, or AWS
